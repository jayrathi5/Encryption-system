In the era of escalating cyber threats, the development of robust encryption and decryption
systems is imperative to safeguard sensitive information. This project aims to explore and
implement cutting- edge techniques in cryptographic algorithms, key management, and
secure communication protocols to fortify data protection mechanisms. The research
focuses on addressing the vulnerabilities present in current encryption standards and
proposes innovative solutions to enhance resilience against evolving cyber threats.
